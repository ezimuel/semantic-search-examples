Title: Edge Native vs. Cloud: come ottimizzare le tue applicazioni

Speaker: Luca Moglia (Akamai Technologies)

Abstract:
As applications demand real-time responsiveness, massive-scale data processing, and uncompromising security, the traditional cloud model is reaching its limits. Edge Native computing emerges as the next step—not just complementing the cloud but redefining it.
Akamai's Edge platform brings compute, storage, and security closer to users, enabling ultra-low latency experiences for AI inference, IoT, Observability at scale, and high-frequency transactions. By distributing workloads intelligently across a global edge network, we reduce congestion, enhance scalability, and mitigate centralized cloud bottlenecks. More importantly, Edge Native isn't just about speed—it's about resilience. Akamai's security-first approach ensures data protection, threat mitigation, and compliance enforcement at the edge, even in the most latency-sensitive environments.
Is Edge Native the next evolution of cloud, or is it a disruption that changes everything? Join us as we explore how businesses can harness Edge Native to achieve unprecedented performance, resilience, and security in a hyper-connected world.
